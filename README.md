# Panceâ€™s dotfiles
Forked from the excellent [dotfiles repository by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

My workflow revolves around Vim and bash.

These dotfiles also include settings and configs for the [Solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) to be used in Vim and bash.

### How to install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pance/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```
